# Problem 1 (Verzani problem 5.1)
*For the `UScereal` (**MASS**) data set, create a scatter plot of `calories` modeled by `sugars` using the `shelf` variable to create different plot characters. Add a legend to indicate the shelf number. Is there any patterns? (Use base R plotting for this problem.)*

## Solution One
```{r, tidy=TRUE, error=TRUE}
library(MASS)
plot(calories ~ sugars, data = UScereal, pch = shelf)
legend(0, 400, c(1, 2, 3), pch = c(1, 2, 3), cex = 0.9)
```

# Problem 2 (Verzani problem 5.3)
*For the data set `UScereal` (**MASS**) make a pairs plot of the numeric variables. Which correlation looks larger: fat and calories or fat and sugars?*

## Solution Two
```{r, tidy=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# Plot relevant data using pairs
relevantData <- UScereal %>% subset(select = c("fat", "sugars", "calories"))

pairs(relevantData, col = UScereal$mfr)
```
Fat and calories seem to be more *interwoven*, hence the *higher* correlation

# Problem 3 (Verzani problem 5.4)
*For the data set `batting` (**UsingR**) make a bubble plot of home runs hit (`HR`) modeled by hits (`H`) where the scale factor for each point is given by `sqrt(SO)/10`. Is there any story to be told by the size of the points? (You must use base R plotting for this problem.)*

## Solution Three
```{r, tidy=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# Bubble plot
blot <- ggplot(batting, aes(x = HR, y = H, size = sqrt(SO)/10)) +
        geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

blot
```
As the number of *hits* increase, so does the number of *home runs*.
