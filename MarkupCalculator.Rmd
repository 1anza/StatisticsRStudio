## Problem 1 (Verzani problem 1.1)
*Use R as you would a calculator to find numeric answers to the following:*

1. $1 + 2(3 + 4)$

```{r}
#Use proper syntax to compute
1 + (2 * (3 + 4))
```

2. $4^3 + 3^{2 + 1}$

```{r}
# Your solution here
(4^3) + (3^(2+1))
```

## Problem 2 (Verzani problem 1.4)
*Use R to compute the following:*

$$\frac{0.25 - 0.2}{\sqrt{0.2(1-0.2)/100}}$$

```{r}
# Your solution here
# Ensure order of operations are followed
(0.25 - 0.2)/(sqrt((0.2 * (1 - 0.2)) / (100)))
```

## Problem 3 (Verzani problem 1.5)
*Assign the numbers 2 through 5 to different variables, then use the variables to multiply all the values.*

```{r}
# Your solution here
a<-2
b<-3
c<-4
d<-5
(a * b * c * d)
```
